                <p>
                  The goal of this project was to create a music app from
                  scratch. I wanted to learn the process of making something
                  that was easy to use but also visually intriguing.

                  I designed the User Experience and the User Interface for this
                  project. I followed these steps:

      <p>
        My design process didn’t have the best start. I got to eager to get to the “fun”
         part so I started doing the prototyping first. I had very little thought about
          the function of the app and focused mostly on what I thought looked good.
           I realized later that I needed a mind-map and wireframes in order to visualize
            the end result and to create something that actually works. So I went back to
             the beginning and made a mindmap, wireframes and user storys then I started 
             doing the prototyping again - with much better result. Below I will show the
              steps I took after going back to the beginning.
