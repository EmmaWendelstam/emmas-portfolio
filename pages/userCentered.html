              <p>
                The project was based on the fact that the Design-agency Xperience AB
                had a request from Willys to create a persona based on their target
                group; Students. In order to become one of the leading foodchains
                Willys wanted to research their targetgroup and create a persona.

              <h1>Interviews</h1>
        <p>The goal with the interviews was to collect as much useful data as possible.
          The questions were designed to help us learn about the users goals, frustrations,
          habits and personalities. We recorded the interviews so that we could transcribe
          them later on. </p>

          Guide and Questions

        <p>
          Our interview guide was created in order for us to structure the questions under
          specific topics and for time estimation. We used qualitative questions in our
          interview script that was designed to give us information that we needed to
          know in order to create the persona.

          We had a total of 25 questions and 3 respondents. All of the questions were
          designed with the purpose of learning as much as possible about the users.

            We used Google Forms to create a quantitative survey and created questions that would tell us as much as possible about our persona. The survey had a total of 35 questions and we had 11 respondents.

              After completing all of the interviews we transcribed
               the audio files. We then coded the text after the categorys:
            </p>
            <div>
              <li>Personality</li>
              <li>Frustrations</li>

              <li>Goals</li>

            </div>
            <p>
              We took out the type value from the survey and compared it
               to the answeres we got from the interviews.

            We made our persona Maria from the results of our research 
            and we structured the findings under basic categorys. We
             felt that the picture expressed her personality and age. 
             The layout was designed in order to show her most important
              personality traits in a clear and easy way.
